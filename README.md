The dataset used for analysis is based on JCPenney, a well-known department store chain, and includes comprehensive information on products, customers, sales trends, and inventory across its stores in the U.S. 
While the dataset provides valuable insights, it incorporates a mix of real and synthetic data to enable detailed analysis. 
This data has been utilized to explore various business questions, uncover trends, and drive data-driven decision-making.


# Structure of Analysis

Before diving into the analytics, let me provide an overview of the process I followed to ensure it is structured in a way that facilitates easy understanding. The process begins with importing the necessary libraries and establishing a connection to Google Drive, where this ipynb Notebook file is stored. The dataset files are also uploaded to the same directory and subsequently loaded into their respective dataframes.

The analysis is organized into three distinct stages:


1.   Data Explortion & Validation
2.   Data Analysis and Visualisation
3.   Data Augmentation

Detailed information about each stage, the steps followed, and comments on the results obtained can be found in the sections below, as each step is executed



Limitations

While there are numerous additional questions that could have been explored to provide valuable insights for JCPenney, two key limitations must be considered:

1.  Data Limitations: The datasets available lack crucial information such as yearly data, order dates and times, store locations, and order types. Having access to this additional data would enable a more in-depth analysis and a clearer understanding of customer behavior and trends.
2.  Business Focus: The questions posed must align with JCPenney's strategic goals and focus areas. Understanding the business's priorities allows for more targeted and actionable insights.
For instance, valuable questions could include analyzing the popularity of different product categories across various age groups and states.

Similarly, assessing brand popularity by age group and geographic region would be insightful. Another critical question could be related to sales performance by product category, which would help JCPenney optimize inventory management and improve in-store processes.

Ultimately, data analysis is always influenced by both the available data and the business objectives. A clear focus and comprehensive data are essential for producing actionable insights.
